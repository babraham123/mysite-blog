A friend of mine recently told me that she was interested in programming, but didn't know where to start. She had already taken an intro course, so she knew how to use if statements, for loops, etc. Still, she felt a large chasm between what she knew and professional code. I sent her a few notes:

Dear Q,

Code academy is a great resource. When I'm starting something new, I usually do a few tutorials, and then try to complete a small project.

For beginners everyone recommends python. The syntax is very straightforward and it has all the basics. Get really comfortable with one language before you branch out.

Lately, I've been interested in web development. I like it a lot, because you can see and interact with the end product. If you already have some experience, building a website is a really fun project.

Here's the path I took over the course of many months:
- Learn html (basics)
- Learn styling with twitter bootstrap
- Start using a python framework (bottle.py or web.py)
- Learn a professional grade framework (django or zend)
         (zend uses php and is a bit outdated, but its also the most common)
- Host your site on a remote server (probably Amazon EC2)

Advanced
- Learn Javascript
- Learn JQuery
- Add dynamic elements to your site
         (This is the hardest part, what people will pay real money for)

Hope that helps!

Cheers,
Bereket
