      <h1 id="Decoupling_web_applications">Decoupling web applications</h1><p>This article outlines a few best practices for developing multiple, independent web applications within the same website or even the same webpage. During my experiments, I used python and nodejs for my server-side software. My research into web apps was motived by my recent expansion of my personal website. In order to showcase my web development skills, I added on a section called Labs, where I prototype interesting web applications. Below are some of the lessons I learned.</p>
<h4 id="Lesson_1,_code_management">Lesson 1, code management</h4><p>Initially, I stored the code for my web apps in the same git repository as the code for my umbrella website, a django app. However, because they functioned independently, I often wanted to develop on and branch each web app differently. So I split the code into multiple repositories and reintroduced them as submodules into the main repo.</p>
<h4 id="Lesson_2,_libraries_and_dependencies">Lesson 2, libraries and dependencies</h4><p>Personally, I like to save as many dependencies as I can locally in the git repo. That way on a fresh machine I can just git clone and be ready to go. For node that simply means removing <code>\node_modules</code> from the <code>.gitignore</code> file. For python you have to use the <code>virtualenv</code> library.</p>
<h4 id="Lesson_3,_routing">Lesson 3, routing</h4><p>So I usually run each app on a random unused port on my server. However, keeping track of the port numbers in my main website was turning out to be a pain. So, I installed nginx and used it to reverse proxy to all of my apps, using human readable routes. For example, <code>/app1:80</code> would map to <code>/localhost:8080</code>. I also used it to serve all of my status content.</p>
<h4 id="Lesson_4,_deployment">Lesson 4, deployment</h4><p>There are a lot of great tools for automated deployment, like Puppet and Jenkins. However, that was total overkill for my website. Instead, I settled for a simple bash script that installs the right config files and restarts the upstart job. I use upstart to run my server as a system service and restart on boot. Each app has its own start script and upstart job.</p>
